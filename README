I'm annoyed at having several versions of the same code from the same day with only small differences that  cannot track, so I'm Trying to get our git repo restarted.

I choose one of the 3 19 dir's at random and uploaded it.

Remember to run with JRE 1.7 and to keep the pictures in the bin folder or you will get the NullPointerException I was complaining about.

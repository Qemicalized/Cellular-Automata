So I created a few classes in an attempt to demonstate sort of what I was thinking. It is in no way 
a complet, perfect or even good solution, just the best I could think of. So feel free to make your
own veriosn, comment, or just tell me I'm doing things all wrong (I probably won't admit it at first
but keep at it and I might)

I also tried to make a slightly more visual representation as Silver requested, but I don't have a perfect
picture of how it's all going to work so once again, feel free to comment on it.
